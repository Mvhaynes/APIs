The latitude vs. maximum temperature scatter plot shows a negative exponential trend with the highest maximum temperatures centered around 0 degrees latitude, which is at the equator. The plot also demonstrates the influence of the earth's tilt - if the earth rotated straight on its axis, we would expect a negative parabolic curve. Instead, we see that the same latitudes on opposite hemispheres receive different amounts of sunlight. Since the weather data was collected in February 2021, the plot shows that the southern hemisphere is warmer than the northern hemisphere, indicating that the north pole is currently tilted away from the sun. 

The scatter plot comparing the northern hemisphere latitudes to maximum temperature has a moderately strong negative correlation of -0.84. Northern hemisphere cities located closer the the equator have higher maximum temperatures and less variance compared to northern hemisphere cities closer to the pole. Again, the influence of the earth's tilt is seen by the lower temperates in cities farthest from the equator. 

Comparisons of wind speed to latitude have very low correlation, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.09 and -0.29 for the northern and southern hemispheres. Some clustering can be seen around 0 degrees latitude with slightly more variance farther from the equator, but overall there does not seem to be much of an effect on wind speed based on latitude.
